* ABOUT macro-C, excn

This is an exception sample implmentation and syntax for C99.

* Restrictions and known None-Features

- There is no support for multitreading yet. The sample implementation
  is not threadsafe.

- Raise while unwinding just re-runs the handler sequence that is
  currently run. The bahviour is determinitic and well defined as fa
  ras the library is concerned, but client code might not be prepared.

- Missing: CATCH_ANY, cat by type mask, configurable
  raise-while-unwinding behaviour (Should the default be to actually
  to propagate to enclosing handler?).
