* ABOUT macro-C

(THIS IS A DUMMY CURRENTLY)

* Installation

There is currently no way to install this library. Just copy the
header files into you project and use the implementation files (*.c)
as starting point to extend the runtime.

The runtime is currently not only usable as-is under very limited
circumstances (as of 2014-11-01 there is no support for multi-treaded
programs), so some adaptions might be necessary.

Please consider the [[License]] before use. This library being mostly
header files means that it can probably only be used in GPL compatible
projects, BUT dual licensing is available:

- Documented and proven free software projects probably only have to
  ask.

- Commercial users will also have to ask, and probably will get an
  alternative license for a minor licensing fee. I insist on that they
  ask, though: I seriously dislike the habit of grabbing parts of free
  software project for their own without caring for licensing terms -
  a habit a major part of the software-for-money industry seems to
  have fallen into during the last dekade.

  This file is to narrow to contain a full treatise on that - but
  approximately half of the devices I currently buy and which run
  embedded Linux seem not to be accompanied by the proper licensing
  documents, nor seem the distributors willing to disgorge the source,
  all patches and/or proper build scripts ...

  So: Commercial users needing a different license: Please ask. We'll
  find a way to come together. If you cannot be bothered to
  communicate, though, using my software is probably not important
  enough for you. I can live with that. Just don't use it or stick to
  the existing [[License]].

Of course I reserve my right to stop any time giving out dual
licenses.
